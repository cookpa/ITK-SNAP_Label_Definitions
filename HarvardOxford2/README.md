# Harvard-Oxford Atlas 2.0 labels

These labels are from the [Harvard-Oxford Atlas 2.0
atlas](https://github.com/HOA-2), not to be confused with the
Harvard-Oxford atlas that is included with FSL.

The color scheme mostly follows the original definition, except that label 3 "CSF" has
been changed from gray to a light purple, to be more visible on T1w.
